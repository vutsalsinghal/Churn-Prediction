# Churn Prediction (Kaggle)

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. 

For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them.
